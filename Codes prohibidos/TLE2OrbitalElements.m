% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set
% http://www.castor2.ca/03_Mechanics/03_TLE/index.html
%% *inputs*
%  TLE - the two line element set corresponding to either Skylab itself or
%        the Apollo capsule that will dock with it for a manned mission
%% *outputs*
%  OE - structure with the orbital elements
%% *notes*
% Skylab 1 was the actual station, while Skylabs 2-4 were the
% Apollo capsules carrying the manned missions to it. 
% According to the informal post on celestia, these
% TLEs are from GSFC, and should be correct for the Epoch.
