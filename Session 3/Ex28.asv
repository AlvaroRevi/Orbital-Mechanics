% Position vector in ECI basis for the three observations 
r1 = [-2014.52,4254.09,5409];
r2 = [-9550.16,-1683.95,9097.54]; 
r3 = [3596.23, -7594.21, -9657.16]; 

% Check that the three positions are coplanar
assert(dot(r1,cross(r2,r3)) < 1e-5); 

% Use r2 as reference and compute D and S 
D = cross(r2,r3) + cross(r2,r1) + cross(r1,r2) ; 
S = (norm(r2)-norm(r3))*r1 + (norm(r3)-norm(r1))*r2 + (norm(r1) - norm(r2))*r3; 

v2 = (1/norm(r2))*sqrt
